\headerbox{1. Introduction}{name=introduction,column=0,row=0, span=2}{Proteins designed artificially have not had the benefit of evolution and are typically designed only to stabilise the native state. Natural proteins, on the other hand, have evolved to function as well as fold in a minimially frustrated fashion. Thus, potential energy landscapes (PELs) of designed proteins are likely to contain topological traps. Here, we study the potential energy landscapes of Top7, a model designed protein and S6, a natural protein of comparable size, using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and discrete path sampling (DPS)[1]. Possible kinetic traps and the energetic barriers separating them from the native state are elucidated. We quantify topological frustration resulting from the designed topology of Top7 with a frustration density parameter[2]. Topological frustration is particularly evident in knotted proteins. Thus, we extend this methodology to locate topological traps on the PEL of some model trefoil knotted proteins.}

Artificial frustration is added by introducing non-native attractive interactions among hydrophobic residues. 
Effect of intercalated water molecules is approximated by a desolvation barrier potential. Effect of side-chain interactions with a statistical two-bead Cheung-Thirumalai potential. See ``Go-kit''[3] for list of models implemented and application of these models to single domain proteins with Discrete Path Sampling and Molecular Dynamics.}

\end{center}
Potential energy landscapes are visualised as microcanonical disconnectivity graphs[3]. Each minimum corresponds to a vertical branch terminating at the corresponding potential energy. For a regular series of threshold energies spaced by a chosen value $\DeltaE$, a superbasin analysis is performed to separate the minima into disjoint sets, whose members can interconvert without exceeding a transition state energy above the current threshold. The branches join at nodes on the vertical (energy) axis as the superbasins merge.

Four separate contact maps depicting the probability of formation of each contact in the ensemble of minima found from DPS. Addition of hydrophobic interactions destabilises the N-terminal region considerably. The SCM method changes the folding route of Top7 making unfolding from the C-terminal more favourable.

Disconnectivity graph representation of a trefoil knotted protein. In keeping with literature [6], structures A1, A2 and A3 were identified as topological traps. Both slip-knotting and plugging mechanisms are observed (See video). First threading event proceeds from the N-terminal. ``Backtracking'' proceeds from the A1 basin.

    \item {Disconnectivity graph representation of a shallow trefoil knot (left) and a deep trefoil knot (right) for the protein HI0766 (YibK,PDBID:1mxi). A shallow knot is defined as one containing 5 residues on either side of the knotted region while a deep knot contains 20 residues on either side of the knotted region. PEL for the deep knot is more frustrated than that of the shallow knot. }
    \item{Each minimum is classified as a knot or an unknot. Knotting begins $\approx$30$\varepsilon$ above the native-state. Low-energy unknotted basins result in the ``backtracking'' mechanism. Multiple pathways leading to the knotted state are observed (See video). Threading proceeds from the C-terminal as observed in experiment. }
