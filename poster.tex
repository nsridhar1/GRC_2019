\headerbox{1. Introduction}{name=introduction,column=0,row=0, span=3}{Proteins designed artificially have not had the benefit of evolution and are typically designed only to stabilise the native state. Natural proteins, on the other hand, have evolved to function as well as fold, and this is a likely source of  frustration. We study the potential energy landscapes of Top7, a model designed protein and S6, a natural protein of comparable size, using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and discrete path sampling (DPS)\cite{Neelamraju17a, Truong} and quantify the frustration resulting from the designed topology of Top7 with a frustration density parameter.   

Topological frustration is particularly evident in knotted proteins. In order to avoid the common problem of chain-crossings that result for C$\alpha$ coarse-grained description, the doubly-nudged elastic band scheme (DNEB) is enhanced with Quasi-Continuous Interpolations (QCI) for coarse-grained structure-based models (SBMs). This allows us to find paths connecting distant conformations that are usually difficult to find with molecular dynamics alone. As an example, we construct kinetic transition networks for three different trefoil knots: MJ0366 (a trefoil knotted protein explored extensively in the past with MD), 1mxiS (a shallow trefoil knot formed by the truncated protein YibK) and 1mxiD (a deep trefoil knot formed by truncated protein YibK). The resulting kinetic transition network identifies topological traps along the potential energy landscapes of each of the three proteins studied. Further, in each case, we identify how high above the native state the process of knotting begins through application of a knot detection algorithm.}
