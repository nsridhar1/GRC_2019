\headerbox{Introduction}{name=introduction,column=0,row=0, span=3}{Proteins designed artificially have not had the benefit of evolution and are typically designed only to stabilise the native state. Natural proteins, on the other hand, have evolved to function as well as fold, and this is a likely source of  frustration. We study the potential energy landscapes of Top7, a model designed protein and S6, a natural protein of comparable size, using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and discrete path sampling (DPS)\cite{Neelamraju17a, Truong} and quantify the frustration resulting from the designed topology of Top7 with a frustration density parameter.   

Topological frustration is particularly evident in knotted proteins. In order to avoid the common problstrem of chain-crossings that result for C$\alpha$ coarse-grained description, the doubly-nudged elastic band scheme (DNEB) is enhanced with Quasi-Continuous Interpolations (QCI) for coarse-grained structure-based models (SBMs). This allows us to find paths connecting distant conformations that are usually difficult to find with molecular dynamics alone. As an example, we construct kinetic transition networks for three different trefoil knots: MJ0366 (a trefoil knotted protein explored extensively in the past with MD), 1mxiS (a shallow trefoil knot formed by the truncated protein YibK) and 1mxiD (a deep trefoil knot formed by truncated protein YibK). The resulting kinetic transition network identifies topological traps along the potential energy landscapes of each of the three proteins studied. Further, in each case, we identify how high above the native state the process of knotting begins through application of a knot detection algorithm.}

Artificial frustration is added by introducing non-native attractive interactions among hydrophobic residues. 
Effect of intercalated water molecules is approximated by a desolvation barrier potential\cite{Chan}. Effect of side-chain interactions with a statistical two-bead Cheung-Thirumalai potential\cite{Cheung}. See Gokit (github.com/gokit1/gokit)\cite{Neelamraju19a} for list of models implemented and application of these models to single domain proteins with Discrete Path Sampling.}

For Top7, the SBM representation shows distinct fluctuation in the frustration density parameter.

Four separate contact maps depicting the probability of formation of each contact in minima found from DPS. Addition of hydrophobic interactions destabilises the N-terminal region considerably. The SCM contact-map changes the folding route. % (a) Probability contact maps for ensemble of minima obtained from DPS  with different contact maps and flavours of SBMs our separate probability contact maps are plotted for potentials from the Cα-SBM with a 4.5 Å cutoff (labeled 4.5), Cα-SBM with non-native hydrophobic interactions (labeled 4.5 + hp), shadow-contact-map algorithm (SMOG server, labeled SCM), and M7 protein (SMOG server, labeled M7(SCM)).
% (b) Four maps are plotted for ensembles derived from MD trajectories at around Tf for the Cα-SBM with a 4.5 Å cutoff (labeled 4.5), Cα-SBM with non-native hydrophobic interactions (labeled 4.5 + hp), shadow-contact-map algorithm (SMOG server, labeled SCM), and Cα-SBM (4.5 Å cutoff), where the contacts interact with a desolvation-barrier-type potential (labeled dsb). The color represents the average Q value of each contact in the ensemble. The experimentally known unfolding pathway proceeds from breaking the β1−β3 bonds that show the least propensity for forming in all the maps except for M7(SCM) and 6.5(SCM). These maps suggest cooperative folding behavior and a clear propensity for the C-terminus unfolding first.
